# Saved&Healthy

It's a simple app that takes data from the Spoonacular API and returns dishes that you can make from things that are left in your fridge (it can also suggest some missing ones)


### The way it works is simple:
 - Enter the products you have
 - Enter the products you don't want in your potential dish
 - Search

The dishes are sorted from the healthiest to the least healthy.

### Technologies/tools used:
  - Python 3.8
  - Django 3.2
  - Spoonicular API
  - Googletrans
